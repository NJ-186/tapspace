    'SABOR, the lioness, suckled her young—a single fuzzy ball,',
    'spotted like Sheeta, the leopard. She lay in the warm',
    'sunshine before the rocky cavern that was her lair, stretched',
    'out upon her side with half closed eyes, yet Sabor was alert.',
    'There had been three of these little, fuzzy balls at first—two',
    'daughters and a son—and Sabor and Numa, their sire, had',
    'been proud of them; proud and happy. But kills had not been',
    'plentiful, and Sabor, undernourished, had been unable to',
    'produce sufficient milk to nourish properly three lusty cubs,',
    'and then a cold rain had come, and the little ones had sickened.',
    'Only the strongest survived—the two daughters had died.',
    'Sabor had mourned, pacing to and fro beside the pitiful bits of',
    'bedraggled fur, whining and moaning. Now and again she',
    'would nose them with her muzzle as though she would awaken',
    'them from the long sleep that knows no waking. At last,',
    'however, she abandoned her efforts, and now her whole savage',
    'heart was filled with concern for the little male cub that',
    'remained to her. That was why Sabor was more alert than',
    'usual.<br>',
    p + 'Numa, the lion, was away. Two nights before he had made',
    'a kill and dragged it to their lair and last night he had fared',
    'forth again, but he had not returned. Sabor was thinking, as she',
    'half dozed, of Wappi, the plump antelope, that her splendid',
    'mate might this very minute be dragging through the tangled',
    'jungle to her. Or perhaps it would be Pacco, the zebra, whose',
    'flesh was the best beloved of her kind—juicy, succulent Pacco.',
    'Sabor’s mouth watered.',
    p + 'Ah, what was that? The shadow of a sound had come to',
    'those keen ears. She raised her head, cocking it first upon one',
    'side and then the other, as with up-pricked ears she sought to',
    'catch the faintest repetition of that which had disturbed her.',
    'Her nose sniffed the air. There was but the suggestion of a',
    'breeze, but what there was moved toward her from the',
    'direction of the sound she had heard, and which she still heard',
    'in a slightly increasing volume that told her that whatever was',
    'making it was approaching her. As it drew closer the beast\'s',
    'nervousness increased and she rolled over on her belly,',
    'shutting off the milk supply from the cub, which vented its',
    'disapproval in miniature growls until a low, querulous whine',
    'from the lioness silenced him, then he stood at her side,',
    'looking first at her and then in the direction toward which she',
    'looked, cocking his little head first on one side and then on the',
    'other.',
